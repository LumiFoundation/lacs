# LACS Asset Classification Standard

**LACS** is a simple system allowing asset creators to label their works in three classes depending on the level AI usage throughout the creation.

**LACS** is developed and maintained by the [Lumi Foundation](https://lumif.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to consumer-focused AI.

## How to Use LACS

1. **Determine the appropriate LACS classification** (LACS-H, LACS-A, or LACS-G) for your asset based on the level of human and AI involvement in its creation. See the [LACS specification](lacs.md) for details.
2. **Add the LACS Label:** Include the LACS label (e.g., `LACS-H`, `LACS-A`, `LACS-G`) in your asset's title, description, or tags. You can also use the LACS badges (see below).
3. **Promote on Social Media:** Use hashtags like `#lacs`, `#lacsH`, `#lacsA`, and `#lacsG` when sharing your assets.

## LACS Badges

You can use these badges to visually identify your assets' LACS classification on your website, in asset stores, or on other platforms.
